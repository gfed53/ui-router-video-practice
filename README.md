This is the first incarnation of the Ultimate YouTube Searcher. 

The goal of this app is to allow the user to gain more freedom in searching for YouTube videos. It is designed to be more lightweight than vanilla YouTube, just as easy to use, but also more powerful when it comes to specifying search parameters.

This app uses CORS requests to get data from the Youtube API, and uses the iframe element to allow embedded YouTube videos within the app. Aside from working further with API hacks using AngularJS, in developing this app I was also introduced to AngularUI router, which utilizes nested states and views. This dependency is more than just a better alternative to ngView; it changes the way a website or app's structure is viewed, and promotes a more modular approach.

I also began following John Papa's Style Guide for best practices in developing AngularJS projects, as I have with other projects.

Goals for the future will be a more advanced search feature and implementation of a playlist feature where users can create a playlist and save it for later.

This is a modest, one-person project, but I hope that all who use it will get the best experience possible. Enjoy!
